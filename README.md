#Machine-Learning-With-Python

This repository has basic machine learning to advanced.This repository has included this:

    1.Data Preprocessing
    2.Simple Linear Regression
    3.Multiple Linear Regression
    4.Polynomial Regression
    5.Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    6.Decision Tree Regression
    7.Random Forest Regression
    8.Logistic Regression
    9.K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
    10.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    11.Naive Bayes
    12.Decision Tree Classification
    13.Random Forest Classification
    14.K-Means Clustering
    15.Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)
    16.Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

Every algorithm include separate branch.which algorithm need then checkout that branch and will get that code.
